    <h1>Welcome to Paintball Pro</h1>

    <p>Paintball Pro is a top-down cooperative shooter inspired by the real-world game Paintball. There are both single player
        (4v4 with AI) and multiplayer (4v4 with real players/AI) versions of the game, with two different game types -
        Team Match and Capture the Flag.</p>

    <p>To play, select either single player or multiplayer from the main menu (you'll be prompted to choose a username, and
        either type an IP address or search LAN for a server for multiplayer games), and then choose a game type to start a game.</p>

    <h2>Game Types</h2>

    <h3>Team Match</h3>
    <p>In Team Match, players are separated into two teams - red and blue - and teams shoot players on the opposing team to
        earn points for their own team. At the end of the 3-minute game, the team with the highest overall score win.</p>

    <h3>Capture the Flag</h3>
    <p>In Capture the Flag, players are separated into the Red and Blue teams, in which players attempt to take
        control of a flag - returning it to their spawn base to earn points for their team. The team with the
        highest number of points at the end of the 3-minute game win.</p>

    <h2>In-Game Controls</h2>
    <p>There are two types of controls available, WASD and arrow keys, and both can be used during games:</p>
