    <h1>Welcome to Paintball Pro</h1>

    <p>Paintball Pro is a top-down cooperative shooter inspired by the real-world game Paintball. There is both a Single Player
        (4v4 with AI) and Multiplayer (4v4 with real players/AI) version of the game, with two different game modes –
        Team Match and Capture the Flag.</p>

    <h2>Team Match</h2>
    <p>In Team Match, players are separated into two teams – Red and Blue, of equal numbers. Teams attempt to shoot
        players on the opposing team to earn points for their own team. At the end of the 3-minute game, the team
        with the highest overall score wins.</p>

    <h2>Capture the Flag</h2>
    <p>In Capture the Flag, teams are once again split into Red and Blue teams
        of equal members, and players attempt to take control of a flag – returning it to their spawn base to earn
        points for their team. The team with the highest number of points at the end of the 3-minute game wins.</p>
